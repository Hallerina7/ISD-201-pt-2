                        <p>My name is <strong>Halle Laura Benson</strong>. I am the second oldest of five children. I was born in Utah but have lived in many places, including Hawaii, where I lived before attending BYU. Living in many places made me quick to adapt and always ready for new challenges and adventures.</p>                 
                        <p>I have always loved academics and pushed myself in school. I graduated from Kahuku High School in Oahu as the number one student with a 4.3 GPA. My father attended BYU as a graduate student, and I spent time as a child on the BYU campus. Attending BYU became a dream of mine, and it was one of the best moments of my life when I was accepted into the school.</p>
                        <p>I have always been business-minded and hope to use this passion by majoring in Strategy at the Marriott School at BYU. I plan to secure internships that will help me get a job in consulting when I graduate. I am working to create a strong professional network through the amazing network of the BYU Business Programs. BYU also has many business clubs that help students obtain internships, and I am taking advantage of this. Upon graduating, I hope to work in management consulting and help businesses improve and grow. Although this will all take hard work, I am definitely up for the challenge.</p>
                        <p> I have a lot of hobbies. I love the beach—especially those on the North Shore of Oahu. I am grateful for this beautiful earth where I can enjoy a sunny day at the beach. I also love skiing, cheer, theatre, singing, and dancing. I enjoy making crafts and doing mind puzzle games. One of my favorite crafts is making jewelry. I also love doing nails and want to get certified so I can start a nail business to support myself through school.</p>
                        <p>I especially love my family and have always strived to set a good example for my siblings. My siblings are my forever friends. I am grateful to my parents who love me and taught me to work hard for what I want. Most of all, I am grateful for my Savior, Jesus Christ, who has given me hope and love always. He has given me everything I have. All these things have made me the girl I am today, and I could not be here without them.</p>
